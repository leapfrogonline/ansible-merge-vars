ansible-merge-vars Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is (loosely) based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Unreleased
Non-functional changes:
- Lint: generator expressions instead of list comprehensions

## 5.0.0

Big thanks to @yeled @ibarrere for info that contributed to this release.

Potentially breaking change:
- The `cacheable` option has been removed from this plugin.  Since Ansible 2.5,
  unless a variable is set by the built-in `set_fact` action plugin, there is
  no way to prevent it from being stored in the persistent fact cache if fact
  caching is enabled.  If you have been using this plugin with Ansible >= 2.5,
  there will be no change in behaviour with this release.

  In order to keep behaviour consistent across Ansible versions, if you have
  been using it with Ansible < 2.5, setting `cacheable` to `true` will no
  longer prevent the merged var from being stored in the persistent fact cache.

  Since every Ansible run, after the first, with the fact cache enabled will
  trigger the `already defined` warning, that warning has been removed.

## 4.0.0

Big thanks again to @vladimir-mencl-eresearch for this improvement!

Potentially breaking change:
- Merge order is now deterministic (alphabetical by fact name).  Hopefully you
  weren't depending on the order in which your facts were merged, but if you
  were, this may change that order.  At least from now on it will be the same
  every time.

## 3.0.0

This plugin is now installable from PyPI, which will make it easier to keep
updated with bug fixes and new features.  As a result, the installation process
is different.  The README has the updated installation process.  If you are
currently using this plugin, you will want to install this version using the
new installation process.

## 2.0.1

Thanks again to @vladimir-mencl-eresearch for fixing a bug where dicts or lists definied in Jinja wouldn't be recursively merged.

## 2.0.0

Big thanks to @vladimir-mencl-eresearch for these additions and improvements!

Potentially breaking change (but you were very likely not depending on this):
- Merged variables are no longer being stored in the fact cache by default

New Features:
- Safety checks for the merged_var_name parameter
- Recursive dict merging
- Documentation updates

## 1.0.0

- Initial version with all functionality and documentation
